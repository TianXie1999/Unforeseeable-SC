# Unforeseeable-SC

This is the code for our paper ```Learning under Imitative Strategic Behavior with Unforeseeable Outcomes```

The experimental results on FICO data and synthetic data can be replicated by using those notebooks:

- ```Experiments in FICO```: This notebook produces all results for the FICO dataset
- ```Gaussian data experiments (not including fairness)```: This notebook produces all results for the Gaussian dataset except the fairness-related experiments
- ```Additional experiments on fairness```: This notebook produces all results for fairness on Gaussian dataset (condition 1.1, 1.2, 2)

The paper is mainly theoretical. You are welcome to check [our paper](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=82bNZGMNZa) which emphasizes more on theoretical analysis.
